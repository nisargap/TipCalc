# Pre-work - *TipCalc*

**TipCalc** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Nisarga Patel**

Time spent: **1.5** hours spent in total

Note: I passed/assisted in teaching this course in Spring 2016 as well, but didn't remember a lot of things as I haven't touched Swift for a while, so I documented more in the ViewController file.

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

## Notes

No particular challenges as I have taken this course in the past, but I am hoping to finish a lot more optionals this time around for the assignments.
